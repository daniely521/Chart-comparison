* **Green Color Scheme:** Employs a visually appealing and consistent green color scheme for a cohesive look.

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML
* CSS

2. Open the file in a web browser.

**How to Use:**

1. Click on the navigation links (Home, Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart) to explore different chart types.
2. View interactive charts and read the descriptions for each chart.

**Further Enhancements:**
